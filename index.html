      <li>As of January 2024, James Milner had played against 2,277 players in the Premier League, equavilent to 48% of all PL players.</li>
      <li>Across the top leagues, around 20-25% of all goals happen in the final 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Since 1998, over 60% of World Cup matches have ended with either a draw or a 1-goal margin.</li>
      <li>Statistically speaking, teams do see a performance bump for around 3-5 games after hiring a new manager, including temporary appointments. However, performance usually reverts to the mean within 10 games.</li>
