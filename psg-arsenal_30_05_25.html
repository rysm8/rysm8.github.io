      <h1>PSG vs Arsenal: Betting Opportunities</h1>
      <p class="date">April 30, 2025</p>

      <p>On Wednesday night, Mikel Arteta's well-coached men in Red face their biggest challenge yet, as they aim to conquer Europe for the first time in their history. PSG stand in the way of a place in the UCL final, as the youthful and exciting side hailing from the Capital of France also look to get their hands on the coveted trophy for the first time in their history.  </p>

      <h2>The Referee:</h2>

      <p>UEFA have confirmed their match official team for the tie, with the Slovenian offical, <strong>Slavko Vincic</strong>, confirmed as referee.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>He has refereed 28 games this season across various leagues and competitions, giving out a total of <strong>123 Yellow Cards</strong> and <strong>3 Red Cards</strong>.</li>
        <li>He has given out an average of <strong>4 Yellow Cards</strong> per UCL game this season, across 9 UCL games in total. He has given no red cards and just <strong>one Penalty</strong> in the UCL this season.</li>
        <li>He tends to let more go in the UCL compared to other leagues/competitions he officiates in, with an average of <strong>24 fouls per game</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Team Disciplinary Stats:</h2>

<p>Arsenal have committed the 4th most amount of fouls in the UCL this season and the most of any team remaining in the competition. We have seen a new side to Mikel Arteta's team this year, particularly with some disciplinary concerns towards the beginning of the PL season, and I expect them to be shrewd on the pitch.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arsenal have <strong>22 Yellow Cards</strong> in the UCL this season, with an average of <strong>1.83 Yellow Cards per game</strong>. That is close to double the amount of cards compared to their opposition.</li>
        <li>Arsenal have committed <strong>131 fouls</strong> in total during this campaign, or <strong>10.92 fouls per game</strong>. They win less fouls than they commit on average.</li>
      </ul>

<p>PSG are a well-disciplined side, receiving less than a card per game on average, despite only commiting around 11.5% less fouls than the team from North London. Though unlike their opposition, they hace received a red card this season, as Dembele was awarded a second yellow during PSG's 1-0 loss to Bayern Munich in the League Phase. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>PSG have <strong>13 Yellow Cards</strong> in the UCL this season, with an average of <strong>0.93 Yellow Cards per game</strong>. PSG have had a fair number of Yellow Cards for dissent.</li>
        <li>PSG have committed <strong>116 fouls</strong> in total during this campaign, or <strong>8.29 fouls per game</strong>. They win more fouls than they commit as they tend to dominate the possession stat, spending less time trying to get the ball back.</li>
      </ul>

<h2>Team Attacking Stats:</h2>

<p>Arsenal and PSG have both scored 30 goals this tournament, but the side from France have had two extra games as a result of finishing 15th in the League Phase, putting 10 goals past Brest in the two-legged tie. Arsenal have scored twice as many goals from outside the box, with around 87% of all PSG goals coming from inside the box.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>PSG have had way more attempts on goal, with <strong>278</strong> compared to Arsenal's <strong>155</strong>. </li>
        <li>Arsenal have committed <strong>131 fouls</strong> in total during this campaign, or <strong>10.92 fouls per game</strong>. They win less fouls than they commit on average.</li>
      </ul>

Though unlike their opposition, they hace received a red card this season, as Dembele was awarded a second yellow during PSG's 1-0 loss to Bayern Munich in the League Phase. </p>
